/**
 * Service detail page — spec v1.2.
 *
 * One template, seven records. This is the whole layout; nothing about it is
 * per-service except the data it reads. A service that has not had its v1.2
 * copy written keeps the older template (see services_.$slug.tsx), so the
 * seven convert one at a time rather than drifting apart.
 *
 * Six sections, answering the five buyer questions in the order they are asked:
 *
 *   01 HERO           white     am I in the right place (copy + one image)
 *   02 SITUATION      surface   do they understand my situation
 *   03 CAPABILITIES   white     can they do this
 *   04 TECHNOLOGY     surface   ...with what
 *   05 WHY ZED        #0a0a0b   why them specifically
 *   06 PROOF + NEXT   white     have they done it / what happens if I write
 *
 * The background rhythm is load-bearing (S3). One dark band, and it is the
 * page's only visual event; a second one at the bottom would spend it. That is
 * why section 06 is white even though a dark closing band is the more common
 * pattern.
 *
 * Colour constraints on this page are measured, not chosen (S38):
 *   #E31937 on #FFFFFF   4.71  eyebrows allowed
 *   #E31937 on #FBFBFA   4.55  eyebrows allowed
 *   #E31937 on #F7F7F5   4.39  FAILS — --secondary carries no red small text
 *   #E31937 on #0A0A0B   4.20  FAILS — dark band uses --dark-lead instead

          01 — HERO

          Two columns: copy left, one image right, tops aligned.

          items-start, not items-center. The text column runs roughly 500px
          and the image 318px, so centring the two left the image floating
          with unequal space above and below it and no shared line anywhere
          on the row. Top-aligned, the eyebrow and the image edge start
          together and the leftover space collects in one place at the
          bottom, which reads as composition rather than as drift.

          The image slot resolves three ways, and the third is the point:

            heroImage set            -> the real image
            no image, draft on       -> a labelled placeholder naming the
                                        subject to source
            no image, draft OFF      -> nothing; the hero returns to the
                                        single-column text-led layout

          A placeholder that renders unconditionally is how a grey box ends
          up on a production page. Tying it to the draft list means
          turning the draft flag off either reveals real images or quietly
          restores a hero that still reads correctly without them.

          {/* The headline spans the full width; the intro, CTA and image sit
              in two columns beneath it.

              Previously the H1 shared a column with the intro and the image
              sat beside all of it. That works when the headline is three
              lines and breaks when it is five: "Get AI out of the
              proof-of-concept stage and into systems your business can
              depend on" pushed the image into the lower right corner with a
              350px hole above it, and no amount of aligning fixed a layout
              where one column carried twice the content of the other.

              Spanning the headline makes the hero independent of how long it
              is. The two columns below it now hold comparable amounts —
              three or four lines of intro plus a button against a 16:9 image
              — which is why they line up on every service rather than on the
              ones whose headline happens to be short. */}

                padding, 5px chip radius, no chip border, 6px chip gap, leading
                dot bullet. Denser than the rounded pills it replaces, and a
                flat chip reads as a label rather than as a button nobody can
                press.

                Its colours are NOT adopted. That spec is FuelUp Youth's
                system — #064E3B, #1B4332, #40916C, #F7FAF5 are a green
                palette belonging to a different brand. Everything here maps to
                ZEDventures tokens instead: chip ground --secondary, chip text
                --foreground, label --subtle-foreground, dot and icon --accent.

                Colour carries the grouping. A 3px rail on the left edge of
                each row and a 12% wash behind that row's chips, both from the
                same tone — the 4px dot alone was correct in principle and
                invisible in practice at real viewing size.

                Four places carry the tone now: a 4px rail on the row's left
                edge, the category label, the chip dot, and a 16% wash with a
                32% border behind each chip.

                Chip text stays #111111 and measures better than 14:1 on every
                wash, so nothing readable depends on the tone. The labels DO
                depend on it: at 10px they are small text and need 4.5:1 on
                white, which is why --tone-d was darkened from #b4651a (4.36,
                failing) to #8f4e12 (6.43). Measured on white: red 4.71, green
                6.02, blue 6.46, amber 6.43.

          measures 4.20:1 here and fails AA. The red survives as a short

          06B — WHAT HAPPENS NEXT

          One sentence. No heading, no button, no eyebrow.

          The headline is back. It came off when the button below it read
          "Discuss your analytics priorities" and the two were the same
          sentence twice; the button now reads "Start a conversation", so they
          are not. Both are per-service and optional, and a service without
          them falls back to the shared wording.

          The line under the headline is the part no competitor service page
          reviewed for this project provides: a statement of what actually
          happens after someone writes.

          The button is deliberately labelled differently from the header's
          "Let's talk" — same destination, but two controls carrying identical
          words read as one repeated element rather than two chances to act.
