/**
 * The statements the careers page carries alongside every posting: benefits,
 * equal opportunity, reasonable accommodation, work authorization,
 * pre-employment checks and how an application is handled.
 *
 * Rendered on the careers index and on every posting detail page, so a candidate
 * who arrives on a role link from a recruiter sees them without having to find
 * the index first.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THE PANELS USE `hidden` RATHER THAN CONDITIONAL RENDERING
 *
 * These are collapsed by default at the client's request. That is a real
 * trade-off: two of them are notices whose purpose is to be seen without being
 * sought — the accommodation notice tells an applicant who cannot use the
 * postal route that another one exists, and the CPRA expects a privacy notice
 * at or before the point an application is collected.
 *
 * So every panel's text is always present in the DOM and merely hidden. It ships
 * in the served HTML, it is found by the browser's in-page search, it prints,
 * and a crawler sees it. Rendering `{open && <p>}` instead would mean the words
 * genuinely are not on the page until someone clicks, which is a materially
 * weaker position to be in.
 *
 * Panels toggle independently — opening one does not close the others.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Removed at the client's request, not by oversight: recruitment fraud, and
 * unsolicited agency resumes.
 *
 * Placeholders remain in the privacy copy — search for "[" in i18n.tsx.
