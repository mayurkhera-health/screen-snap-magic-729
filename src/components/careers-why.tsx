/**
 * "Why join us" — three claims about working here.
 *
 * PLACEHOLDER CONTENT. The three lines in i18n.tsx are bracketed markers, not
 * copy. They have to be replaced with claims that are true of every role and
 * every location, because a candidate reads them as promises: the postings
 * cover San Jose plus "various unanticipated client locations," so anything
 * tied to one office or one team is wrong for most of the people reading it.
 *
 * Delete this section rather than launch it with the markers showing.
 *
 * Hairline-divided columns, no card borders or shadows, per the design spec.
 * Icons are stroke line icons at 20px — no emoji anywhere on this page.
