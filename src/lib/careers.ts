/**
 * Careers framework.
 *
 * Every open role is one entry in POSTINGS below. Adding a role means adding an
 * object; nothing else has to change. The route, the index listing, the SEO
 * metadata and the Google Jobs structured data are all generated from this file.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THE TYPES ARE STRICT
 *
 * Several fields the compiler insists on are not design preferences, they are
 * the things a US job posting is expected to carry:
 *
 *   pay            California SB 1162 requires the pay scale in any posting for
 *                  a role that could be filled in California. It is a required
 *                  field here so a posting cannot ship without one.
 *   locations      "various unanticipated client locations" style wording on an
 *                  immigration notice has to survive intact, so it is a list of
 *                  free strings rather than a structured address.
 *   sourceOfText   Marks a posting whose wording comes from a government filing.
 *                  See the warning below.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * VERBATIM POSTINGS — READ BEFORE EDITING
 *
 * A posting with sourceOfText: "filing" carries text taken from an immigration
 * filing (ETA-9089, LCA or similar). That wording is legally load-bearing: it is
 * expected to match the filing. DO NOT rewrite it for tone, tighten it, fix its
 * grammar, expand its abbreviations or reflow its sentences. If it reads awkwardly,
 * that is not a bug. Change it only by copying new text from the filing itself.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * DRAFT MODE
 *
 * While DRAFT_CAREERS is true the pages carry a draft banner, emit
 * robots: noindex and suppress the JobPosting structured data, so nothing
 * incomplete reaches Google Jobs. Set it to false once every posting's
 * `unverified` array is empty.
