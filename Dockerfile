# npm, NOT bun. bun.lock pins culori to Lovable's private registry
# (europe-west4-npm.pkg.dev/lovable-core-prod/...), which returns 403 outside
# their sandbox, so `bun install --frozen-lockfile` cannot work in a build like
# this one. package-lock.json resolves everything from registry.npmjs.org.

# `npm install`, not `npm ci`: this dependency tree resolves two ajv majors,
# which npm ci rejects as "lock file out of sync" even on a lockfile npm has
# just generated itself. Verified from a clean checkout.
